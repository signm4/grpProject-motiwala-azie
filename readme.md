*Two things we enjoyed doing this project: 
1.) The freedom to pick any idea we wanted
2.) being able to add as many/little features as we wanted

*Two things we didn't enjoy doing in the project: 
1.) How even the smallest error could cause the entire app to not work
2.) finding a music api that would let us just search up the music with an Oauth or just a regular API key
